# Summary

A Universal Dependencies treebank for the Old Irish Würzburg glosses.


# Introduction

The Diplomatic Würzburg Glosses Treebank (DipWBG) has been compiled as part of a PhD research project by Adrian Doyle at the National University of Ireland, Galway. These glosses were written during the 8th century in Latin and Old Irish. Only those glosses which contain some Irish text are collected here, however, many of these include code-mixing between Irish and Latin. These glosses relate to the Pauline Epistles and commentaries thereon.

The Old Irish text used in this treebank has been drawn from the Würzburg Irish Glosses website (www.wurzburg.ie). The treebank currently contains 42 glosses, though more will be added in future updates as annotation continues. Because of the rarity of Old Irish text surviving in manuscripts from the period, and because annotation has been completed for only a handful of these to date, only a test set is yet available.
